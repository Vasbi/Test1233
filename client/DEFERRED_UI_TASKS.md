# Deferred UI/UX Tasks for RiskTrackPro-3

The following UI/UX improvements are important for future development, but are currently on hold:

1. Expand Syncfusion DataGrid usage and advanced features (inline editing, validation, export, batch actions) to all features (Project Schedule, Analytics, Documents, Permissions, etc.)
2. Ensure all UI dialogs, popovers, and notifications use a consistent Syncfusion or custom design system

These tasks should be revisited after current priorities are complete.
