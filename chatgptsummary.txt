Certainly! Here’s a **detailed summary** you can use to transfer context to a new user or AI assistant, including what has already been done and what still needs to be completed:

## **RiskTrackPro-3 Migration & Modernization – Detailed Summary**

### **What Has Been Done**

#### **1. Frontend Refactor**
- Migrated to a **feature-based folder structure** for all major domains (Risks, Issues, Critical Dates, Project Schedule, Analytics, Settings, TestAI).
- All Risk-related components, hooks, and logic are now in risks and exported via a single `index.ts` for modularity.
- Legacy components in components have been removed after verifying all functionality was migrated.
- Issues and Critical Dates features have also been modularized in their own folders, with their main tables and hooks migrated.
- All feature folders now export their main components and hooks via their own `index.ts` files.
- Imports throughout the app are being updated to use feature-based paths.
- **Syncfusion** is installed and a starter `SyncfusionRiskTable.tsx` using Syncfusion DataGrid is in place in the risks feature folder.
- Hooks like `useRisks` and `useIssues` are modularized and exported from their respective feature folders.
- All legacy code for Risks, Issues, and Critical Dates has been checked for completeness and removed if fully migrated.

#### **2. UI Modernization**
- Syncfusion is now the core UI framework for tables and forms.
- The Risk table is ready for further Syncfusion DataGrid customization.
- Plan in place to migrate all tables, forms, and modals to Syncfusion equivalents for a unified UX.

#### **3. State & Data**
- Feature-specific hooks (e.g., `useRisks`, `useIssues`, `useCriticalDates`) are modularized.
- Plan to centralize API client and state management for scalability (e.g., using Zustand or Redux Toolkit).

#### **4. Backend & Shared Types**
- Plan to migrate backend to **NestJS** for modular, scalable APIs with TypeScript and OpenAPI support.
- Plan to use shared types and validation schemas (e.g., Zod) across client and server for type safety.

### **What Still Needs To Be Done**

#### **Frontend**
- **Syncfusion Integration:**  
  - Complete the migration of all tables, forms, and modals to Syncfusion components for all features (Risks, Issues, Critical Dates, etc.).
  - Implement advanced Syncfusion features (editing, filtering, command columns, modals, etc.).
- **State Management:**  
  - Centralize API calls and global state management (e.g., Zustand/Redux Toolkit).
  - Ensure all hooks and components use the new centralized state and API client.
- **Testing & Documentation:**  
  - Add/expand unit and integration tests for feature components and hooks.
  - Set up Storybook for documenting reusable Syncfusion components.

#### **Backend**
- **NestJS Migration:**  
  - Scaffold a new NestJS backend.
  - Modularize backend by feature (Risk, Issue, CriticalDate, Document, AI).
  - Implement DTOs, validation, and OpenAPI docs.
  - Integrate with the existing database (Drizzle ORM or Prisma).
  - Move business logic to services and repositories.
  - Isolate AI/ML logic in a dedicated module/service.
- **Shared Types:**  
  - Generate and share types between backend and frontend.
  - Use Zod or similar for validation schemas.

#### **General**
- **Monorepo Tooling:**  
  - Set up Nx or Turborepo for monorepo management, caching, and enforcing boundaries.
- **CI/CD:**  
  - Set up automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update project documentation to reflect new structure and workflows.

### **How to Continue**

1. **Pick up from the modularized feature folders.**
2. **Continue Syncfusion UI migration** for all features, starting with Risks and then Issues, Critical Dates, etc.
3. **Centralize state management and API client** for all features.
4. **Begin backend migration to NestJS** and modularize by feature.
5. **Integrate shared types and validation** across client and server.
6. **Expand testing and documentation** as new features/components are migrated.
